Wraithaven Sculpt is a plugin designed for Project Rainbow, by TheDudeFromCI. It was created
for the purpose of easily mass editing a Minecraft world. One thing that separates Wraithaven
Sculpt from is competitors is the ability to preform all edits without lagging your server. No
matter how large or small.

3) Copy and Undo Points:
	-----
	Copy, Paste, Undo, and Redo are done slightly different then from what you're used to.
	-----
	* Copy/Paste: For copy and paste, all objects copied are saved to file instead of to clipboard. This method has several advantages.
		- Unlimited objects can be copied at once.
		- Multiple objects can be copied and pasted at once, in any order.
		- Copying large structures won't chew up server RAM.
		- Objects copied won't be lost if the server restarts or crashes.
		- Schematics can be saved for days, weeks, or even years if you want.
		- Schematics can be traded between to servers. (Rename to the next number so the plugin can find it properly!)
	* Undo/Redo: For undo and redo, all edits made create an "undo point." An undo point is file that stores a list of blocks changed.
		Both before, and after the edit. The advantages of this system:
		- Unlined undo points.
		- Undo or redo in any order.
		- Won't waste server RAM trying to remember everything it just did.
		- Undo or redo edits you made days ago.
		- You can use redo to rebuild a damaged area, if it's saved. :)
				For this one, just copy the entire area, delete it all, and paste it again in the same location. Keep note of the edit
				number!
4) Permissions:
	** Currently not available! Only OPs have permission to use anything. **
5) Selecting Points:
	Point selection, (also referred to as chisel locations) are two points you select for use be several commands.
	Selecting points can be done by taking a wooden axe, and clicking on the blocks you wish to select. Left clicking
	sets point 1. Right clicking sets point 2.
